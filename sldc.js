// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "2nd step. Collecting all relevant information from the customer to make a product as per their expectation. Once the requirements are all done, SRS(Software Requirement Specification) will be created."
const design = "3rd step. Designing and developing the product."
const testingIntegration = "4th step. Product gets tested to make sure it works perfectly without any bugs."
const implementation = "5th step. Final version of the product gets relaesed to the market."
const maintain = "6th step. Maintain the procduct. If issues come up they have to be fixed or any new enhancement that need to be added."
